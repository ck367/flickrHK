Making use of the Flickr API I am able to view my album as well as search it.

A simple program that makes use of the JSON responses to retrieve images and image information from a specified photo album. Then after the elements are built using JavaScript you can search them to narrow down the displayed pictures. 

To test it yourself you will need your own API key from Flickr, it is free and easy to request one, you just need a Flickr account.
Once you Have an account you can apply for a key here >> https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply
When you have a key navigate to "main.js" and at the top of the function there is a variable declaration "var apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';", put your new API key in here. Save and then run.

If you do not wish to do that you can navigate to the wiki page for some screenshots.
